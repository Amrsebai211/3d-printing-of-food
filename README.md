## Abstract
The demand for 3D food printing (3DFP) is increasing due to the technological advancements in modern society. 3DFP has the potential to transform food production by enhancing culinary creativity through digital capabilities. Although still in its early stages, 3DFP is an important technology that can be adopted globally to meet the rising demand for customized food.

The 3D food cooking printer is designed to both print and cook food simultaneously. This project involves designing, implementing, and controlling a 3D food cooking printer, with the creation and testing of a prototype.

### Project Goals:
- Conceptual Description
- Design Control System
- Load Analysis on Initial Design
- Selection of Proper Material and Components
- 3D Design
- System Programming
- Final Product Testing
